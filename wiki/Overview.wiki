#summary Overview of project and additional notes

= Introduction =

As the Project Home states, this is an open source project I am working on that anyone can use for anything. I am not a master of the GPL license, but you can use anything on here for commercial or non-commercial use.


= Details =

Since this project is still in its _figuring out_ stage, there won't be much details here for now. I will try to zip the whole projects up as I go along. I am envisioning having everything in one zip file, where you can get the code and final assets. 

I will also provide a separate zip file for the editable resource files like photoshop or blender files. They will be pretty big, so I think keeping them separate from the final asset files is a good idea.
